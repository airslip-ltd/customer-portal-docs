# Overview

<p class="description">Get real-time financial data on your clients through visual dashboards</p>

Airslip enables credit institutions to access real-time financial data on their business clients to help mitigate risk & exposure for loans, insurance and trade credit.

Airslip provides a web-based portal that allows you to utilise business financial data through our banking, commerce and accounting integrations without technical development. The portal enables you to assess the financial health of your business customers through visually appealing dashboards.

The Airslip API powers the portal, which means that the functionality in the portal is also available if you use the API directly.

## What can I do on the Airslip Portal

The Airslip Portal enables you to:

- View common accounting [statistic & metrics](https://github.com/airslip-ltd/customer-portal-docs/wiki/Statistics-&-Metrics)
