# User roles

There are three levels of users on Airslip which have access to different functionality.

* User
* Manager
* Administrator

## User

Users have the ability to view data but not change, such as view business data, notifications and connected business insights.

## Manager

Manager users have access to all the functionality available in Airslip except the ability to create, edit and remove other users. This includes all of the user's abilities as well as the being able to create, edit and delete businesses, and underwriting rules and settings.

## Administrator

Administrator users have full access to all the features available in the Airslip portal. They are the only users who are able to add, edit and remove other users from your account. This includes all levels of user so any Administrator can remove other Administrator, Manager, and User users.
