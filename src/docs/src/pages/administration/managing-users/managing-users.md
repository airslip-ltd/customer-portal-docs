# Managing users

## Add a new user

When you first gain access to Airslip, you'll be set up with a single Administrator account. The account uses the email address of the main point of contact requested during onboarding. This Administrator user can then add new users with different levels of access.

For an explanation of what each user level means, please see [User roles](/administration/user-roles).

To add new users from the [Airslip Portal](/getting-started/usage/).

1. Open the [Airslip Portal](/getting-started/usage/) and log in to your Administrator account.
2. In the left navigation pane;, select **Account > Users**.
3. Select **Create new user** and fill in the user's name and email address.
4. From the **User Role** list, select the [correct permission](/docs/user-roles) level for the user.
5. To complete the account set up, select **Send invitation**.
6. An email is sent to the user of the new account for them to verify their account details. During this process, they also set up a password.

## Edit existing account details

At any time, users with Administrator access can update a user's account details, including their name, email address and access level. Administrators can also enable or disable accounts.

1. Complete steps 1 and 2 in [Add a new user](#add-a-new-user).
2. Find the user details you're interested in and select **Edit** next to them.
3. Change any details that you need to and then select **Save changes**.
