# Operating margin

This metric looks at how much operating profit the company generates from each dollar of sales revenue. It is calculated as operating income, or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), divided by net sales revenue. Operating income is the profit a company makes on sales revenue after deducting COGS and operating expenses. ROS is commonly used as a measure of how efficiently the company turns revenue into profit.

## Formula

> Return on sales = (Earnings before interest and taxes / Net sales) x 100%
