# Return on assets (ROA)

This efficiency metric shows how well an operations management team uses its assets to generate profit. It takes into account all assets, including current assets such as accounts receivable and inventory, as well as fixed assets, such as equipment and real estate. ROA excludes interest expense, as financing decisions are typically not within operating managersâ€™ control.

## Formula

> Return on assets = Net income / Total assets for period
