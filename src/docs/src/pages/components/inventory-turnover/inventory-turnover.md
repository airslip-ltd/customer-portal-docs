# Inventory turnover

This operational efficiency metric shows the number of times the average balance of inventory was sold during a period, typically a year. In general, a low inventory turnover ratio can indicate that the company is buying too much inventory or that sales are weak; a higher ratio indicates less inventory or stronger sales. An extremely high ratio could indicate that the company doesnâ€™t have enough inventory to meet demand, limiting sales.

## Formula

> Inventory turnover = COGS / Average inventory balance for period
