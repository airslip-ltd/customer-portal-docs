# Interest coverage

A long-term solvency KPI, interest coverage quantifies a companyâ€™s ability to meet contractual interest payments on debt such as loans or bonds. It measures the ratio of operating profit to interest expense; a higher ratio suggests that the company will be able to service debt more easily.

## Formula

> Interest coverage = EBIT / Interest expense
