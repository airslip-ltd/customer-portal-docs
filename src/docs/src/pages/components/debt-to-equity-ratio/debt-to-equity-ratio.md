# Debt-to-equity ratio

This ratio looks at a company’s borrowing and the level of leverage. It compares the company’s debt with the total value of shareholder’s equity. The calculation includes both short-term and long-term debt. A high ratio indicates that the company is highly leveraged. This may not be a problem if the company can use the money it borrowed to generate a healthy profit and cash flow.

## Formula
 
> Total liabilities / Total shareholders’ equity
