# Operating cash flow ratio (OCF)

This liquidity KPI ratio measures a company’s ability to pay for short-term liabilities with cash generated from its core operations. It’s calculated by dividing operating cash flow by current liabilities. OCF is the cash generated by a company’s operating activities, while current liabilities include accounts payable and other debts that are due within a year. OCF uses information from a company’s statement of cash flows, rather than the income statement or balance sheet, which removes the impact of non-cash operating expenses.

## Formula

> Operating cash flow ratio = Operating cash flow / Current liabilities
