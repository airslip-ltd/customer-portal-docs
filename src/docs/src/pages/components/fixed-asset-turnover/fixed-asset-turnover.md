# Fixed asset turnover ratio

This shows a companyâ€™s ability to generate sales from its investment in fixed assets. This KPI is especially relevant to companies that make significant investments in property, plant and equipment (PPE) in order to increase output and sales. A higher ratio indicates that the company is using those fixed assets more effectively. The average fixed asset balance is calculated by dividing total sales by net of accumulated depreciation.

## Formula

> Fixed asset turnover = Total sales / Average fixed assets
