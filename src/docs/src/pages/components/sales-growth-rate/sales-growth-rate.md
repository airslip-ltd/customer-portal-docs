# Sales growth rate

One of the most critical revenue KPIs for many companies, sales growth shows the change in net sales from one period to another, expressed as a percentage. Companies often compare sales to the corresponding period during the previous year, or quarter-to-quarter changes in sales during the current year. A positive value indicates sales growth; negative values mean sales are contracting.

## Formula

> (Current net sales â€“ Prior period net sales) / Prior period net sales x 100
