# Net profit margin

This is a comprehensive measure of how much profit a company makes after accounting for all expenses. It’s calculated as net income divided by revenue. Net income is often regarded as the ultimate metric of profitability — the “bottom line” — because it’s the profit remaining after deducting all operating and non-operating costs, including taxes. Net profit margin is usually expressed as a percentage.
