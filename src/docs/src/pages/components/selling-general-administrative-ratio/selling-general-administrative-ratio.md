# Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) ratio

This efficiency metric indicates what percentage of sales revenue is used to cover SG&A expenses. These expenses can include a broad range of operational costs, including rent, advertising and marketing, office supplies and salaries of administrative staff. Generally, the lower the SG&A ratio, the better.

## Formula

> (Selling + General + Administrative expense) / Net sales revenue
