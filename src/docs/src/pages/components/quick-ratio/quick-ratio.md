# Quick ratio/acid Test

The quick ratio is a liquidity risk KPI that measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term obligations by converting quick assets into cash. Quick assets are those current assets that can be converted into cash without discounting or writing down the value. In other words, quick assets are current assets – inventory. The quick ratio is also known as the acid test ratio because it’s used to measure the financial strength of a business. It reflects the organization’s ability to generate cash quickly to cover its debts if it experiences cash flow problems. Companies often aim for a quick ratio that’s greater than one.

## Formula

> Quick ratio = Quick assets / Current liabilities
