# Current accounts receivable ratio

This metric reflects the extent to which the company’s customers pay invoices on time. It’s calculated as the total value of sales that are unpaid but still within the company’s billing terms in relation to the total balance of all AR. A higher ratio is generally better because it reflects fewer past-due invoices. A low ratio shows the company is having difficulty collecting money from customers and can be an indicator of potential future cash flow problems.

## Formula

> (Total accounts receivable – Past due accounts receivable) / Total accounts receivable
