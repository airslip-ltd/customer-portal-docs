# Current ratio

This shows a companyâ€™s short-term liquidity. Itâ€™s the ratio of the companyâ€™s current assets to its current liabilities. Current assets are those that can be converted into cash within a year, including cash, accounts receivable and inventory. Current liabilities include all liabilities due within a year, including accounts payable. Generally, a current ratio below one may be a warning sign that the company doesnâ€™t have enough convertible assets to meet its short-term liabilities.

 ## Formula

> Current assets / Current liabilities
