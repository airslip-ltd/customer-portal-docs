# Budget variance

This compares the company’s actual performance to budgets or forecasts. Budget variance can analyze any financial metric, such as revenue, profitability or expenses. The variance can be stated in dollars or, more often, as a percentage of the budgeted amount. Budget variances can be favorable or unfavorable, with unfavorable budget variances typically shown in parentheses. A positive budget variance value is considered favorable for revenue and income accounts, but it can be unfavorable for expenses.
