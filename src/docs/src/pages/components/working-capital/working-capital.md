# Working capital

This liquidity measure is often used in conjunction with other liquidity metrics, such as the current ratio. Like the current ratio, it compares the company’s current assets with its current liabilities. However, it expresses the result in dollars instead of as a ratio. Low working capital may indicate that the company will have difficulty meeting its financial obligations. Conversely, a very high amount may be a sign that it’s not using its assets optimally.

## Formula

> Working capital = Current assets – Current liabilities
