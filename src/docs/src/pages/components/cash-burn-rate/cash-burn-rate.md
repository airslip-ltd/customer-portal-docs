# Cash burn rate

Generally used as a KPI by loss-generating startups, burn rate measures the rate at which the company uses up its available cash to cover operating expenses. The higher the burn rate, the faster the company will run out of cash unless it can attract more funding or receives additional financing. Investors often examine a companyâ€™s gross burn rate when considering whether to provide funding.
