# Gross profit margin

This is an intermediate — but critical — measure of the profitability and efficiency of the company’s core business. It’s calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, and is usually expressed as a percentage. Gross profit is net sales minus cost of goods sold (COGS), which is the direct cost of producing the items sold. Calculating profit as a percentage of revenue makes it easier to analyze profitability trends over time and to compare profitability with other companies.

## Formula

> Gross profit margin = (Net sales – COGS) / Net sales x 100%
