# Credit notes

Think of a credit note as a voucher issued to a customer. It is a reduction that can be applied against one or multiple invoices. A credit note can either reduce the amount owed or cancel out an invoice entirely.

In the Airslip system a credit note is issued to a [customer's](/data-model/accounting/customers) accounts receivable.

It contains details of:

* The amount of credit remaining and its status.
* Payment allocations against the payments type, in this case an invoice.
* Which customers the credit notes have been issued to.
